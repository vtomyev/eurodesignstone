      content : Excellent work. Shower floor grouting was failing. After assessing the flooring underneath the tile, we decided to replace the tile. Ruslanâ s work was exceptional, the price was very reasonable, and the project was completed with little disruption. All aspects were explained as the project progressed. The clean-up was complete. In fact, Ruslan applied calling beyond the scope of this project. I unequivocally recommend Euro Design Stone!
